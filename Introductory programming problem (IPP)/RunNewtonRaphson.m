% This function should run the Newton-Raphson method, making use of the
% other relevant functions (StepNewtonRaphson, DifferentiatePolynomial, and
% GetPolynomialValue). Before returning iterationValues any non-plottable values 
% (e.g. NaN) that can occur if the method fails (e.g. if the input is a
% first-order polynomial) should be removed, so that only values that
% CAN be plotted are returned. Thus, in some cases (again, the case of
% a first-order polynomial is an example) there may be no points to plot.

function iterationValues = NewtonRaphson(polynomialCoefficients, startingPoint, tolerance)
